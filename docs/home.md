Hello and welcome to my personal brain. This is where I do my record keeping of
interesting software I've used in the past and/or know well. By writing things
down here, I build my own knowledge on the subject and learn technologies more
thoroughly.

All the opinions here are mine. They do not represent the views of my employer
or any possible 3rd party I may affiliated with.
